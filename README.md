# Chengyu Hangman
Chengyu Hangman is a fun and minimalist game built with TypeScript + React where, given tiles containing 54 Chinese characters, you need to guess the correct four letter idiom (成语 chéngyǔ). I had the idea for this because I was thinking about how a Chinese game of hangman would work. Obviously it's not an alphabetic language, which presents unique challenges for this type of word game, so I knew I needed to somehow shrink the number of possible words while keeping it to a common set of characters that could be represented by tiles. I got the list of chengyus from a Stack Exchange post, then I wrote a really simple Python script to extract the 54 most common characters and then output the chengyus from the list that can be formed with only those most common characters.
